# ✅ Map Generation Improvements - Complete!

## What I've Done

### 🎯 Core Improvements

1. **Ocean Boundary System**
   - Map now has **radius 8** (up from 7) = ~200 hexes
   - **Forced 1-hex ocean boundary** on all edges
   - Edge tiles always set to elevation 0 and marked as ocean
   - No land can spawn in outermost ring

2. **Natural Coastline**
   - Added **coastline noise** (separate noise layer)
   - Edge noise strength: 0.25 (adjustable)
   - Creates irregular, natural-looking shores
   - Island won't be a perfect hexagon

3. **Improved Land Coverage**
   - Reduced falloff exponent: 2.0 → 1.8 (gentler falloff)
   - Adjusted land threshold: 0.35 → 0.30 (more land)
   - Changed elevation blend: 65% falloff + 35% noise → 50/50 split
   - Result: **~70-80% of map is land** (excluding ocean boundary)

4. **Multiple Rivers**
   - Now generates **2 rivers** instead of 1 (configurable)
   - Better water distribution across island
   - Improved pathfinding scores

5. **Enhanced Stats Tracking**
   - Now reports: total tiles, land/sea counts, **land percentage**, edge tiles
   - Easier to verify generation parameters

## Configuration Parameters

All configurable in `mapEngine.js` constructor:

```javascript
config = {
  radius: 8,                    // Map size (8 = ~200 hexes)
  oceanBoundaryWidth: 1,        // Force ocean at edges
  elevationScale: 0.18,         // Terrain roughness
  moistureScale: 0.14,          // Moisture variation
  falloffExponent: 1.8,         // Edge dropoff (lower = more land)
  landThreshold: 0.30,          // Sea level (lower = more land)
  edgeNoiseStrength: 0.25,      // Coastline irregularity (0-1)
  beachWidth: 1,                // Beach tile depth
  riverSources: 2               // Number of rivers
}
```

**To adjust island shape:**
- Increase `edgeNoiseStrength` (0.3-0.4) → More irregular coast
- Decrease `falloffExponent` (1.5-1.7) → More land near edges
- Lower `landThreshold` (0.25-0.28) → More total land

## Future Features Framework

I've added **placeholder methods** in `mapEngine.js` for future expansion:

### Ready to Implement:
1. ✅ `placePOIs()` - Points of Interest (shipwrecks, ruins, caves, etc.)
2. ✅ `defineFactionTerritories()` - Territory control and encounters
3. ✅ `placeResourceNodes()` - Gatherable resources (fruit, stone, fish, etc.)
4. ✅ `initializeFogOfWar()` - Exploration and discovery system
5. ✅ `placeLandmarks()` - Named locations for navigation

Each has:
- Detailed comments explaining purpose
- Design notes on implementation
- Example data structures
- TODO lists for implementation

## Design Document

**`MAP_GENERATION_DESIGN.md`** contains:

### Current System
- Complete explanation of 7-step generation pipeline
- All 11 biome types with descriptions
- How each step works

### Future Features (Detailed Plans)
1. **Points of Interest (POIs)**
   - 9 types: Shipwrecks, ruins, caves, waterfalls, volcano, etc.
   - Rarity system: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary
   - Narrative integration for each type
   - Placement algorithm design

2. **Faction Territories**
   - 5 faction types: Survivors, Natives, Wildlife, Pirates, Cultists
   - Territory sizes, hostility levels, quest types
   - Natural boundary following
   - Encounter system design

3. **Resource Nodes**
   - 12+ resource types organized by category
   - Renewable vs. finite resources
   - Density and regeneration times
   - Quality scaling by danger/remoteness

4. **Fog of War**
   - 3 visibility states: Unexplored, Explored, Visible
   - Vision range mechanics
   - High ground bonuses
   - Rendering strategy

5. **Landmarks**
   - 5 major landmark types with descriptions
   - Multi-tile structures
   - Auto-detection algorithm
   - Quest integration

## What to Test

Run the game and check:

1. **Ocean Boundary**
   - [ ] Is there a complete ocean ring around the island?
   - [ ] Is it exactly 1 hex wide?

2. **Land Coverage**
   - [ ] Does land extend almost to the edge (within 1 hex)?
   - [ ] Is ~70-80% of the map land?

3. **Coastline**
   - [ ] Does the coast look natural and irregular?
   - [ ] Not a perfect circle/hexagon?

4. **Rivers**
   - [ ] Are there 2 rivers flowing to the sea?
   - [ ] Do they start in mountains?

5. **Biomes**
   - [ ] Natural distribution (beaches on coast, forests inland, mountains in center)?
   - [ ] No weird single-tile artifacts?

## Next Steps (When You're Ready)

### Immediate:
1. Test the new map generation
2. Adjust parameters if needed:
   - More irregular coast? Increase `edgeNoiseStrength`
   - More/less land? Adjust `landThreshold`
   - Different island shape? Change `falloffExponent`

### Future Implementation (Pick One):
1. **Start with POIs** - Most visual impact, easiest to implement
   - Add shipwrecks on beaches
   - Place 1-2 ruins in jungle
   - Add cave entrance in mountains

2. **Resource System** - Core gameplay loop
   - Fruit trees in forests
   - Fishing spots on rivers
   - Stone outcrops in mountains
   - Implement gathering mechanics

3. **Fog of War** - Exploration feeling
   - Hide unexplored tiles
   - Reveal on approach
   - Track discovered POIs

4. **Factions** - Most complex, wait for story design
   - Define faction behaviors first
   - Design encounter system
   - Create quest chains

## Files Modified

1. **`src/modules/mapEngine.js`**
   - Updated constructor with new config
   - Rewrote `generateElevation()` with ocean boundary
   - Updated `thresholdLandSea()` to respect edge tiles
   - Enhanced `carveRiver()` for multiple rivers
   - Added `getMapStats()` land percentage
   - Added 6 placeholder methods for future features

2. **`src/utils/hexGrid.js`**
