# Map Analysis & Improvement Opportunities

## Your Questions Answered

### 1. ✅ Does Ridge Village Spawn Near Mountains?
**YES** - The Ridge Village has strict requirements:
- Elevation ≥ 0.6 (60%+) - highlands/mountains only
- Prefers terrain with "hill" or "peak" in name (jungle-hill, rocky-peak, misty-peak, etc.)
- Bonus for defensibility (difficult terrain neighbors)
- Must be far from coast (interior location)

### 2. ❌ Island Edges - Currently ALL Beach
**PROBLEM**: Every land tile adjacent to sea becomes 'beach'. No variety!

**OPPORTUNITY**: Add cliff edges for visual and gameplay variety
- High elevation coastline → Cliffs (impassable, no landing)
- Low elevation coastline → Beaches (accessible)
- Benefits: Strategic naval considerations, varied visuals, natural defenses

### 3. 🎨 Current Biome Colors (10 terrain types)

```javascript
WATER/COAST:
- 'sea'          → #1e3a8a (deep blue)
- 'beach'        → #fde047 (yellow/sand)
- 'river'        → #3b82f6 (bright blue)

LOWLANDS (elev < 0.5):
- 'savanna'      → #a3e635 (lime green) - dry
- 'forest'       → #22c55e (green) - moderate moisture
- 'rainforest'   → #15803d (dark green) - wet

HILLS (0.5-0.7 elev):
- 'dry-hill'     → #a8a29e (tan/grey) - arid
- 'jungle-hill'  → #65a30d (olive green) - wet jungle
- 'cloud-forest' → #6ee7b7 (mint/teal) - mystical high moisture

MOUNTAINS (0.7+ elev):
- 'rocky-peak'   → #78716c (dark grey) - dry peaks
- 'misty-peak'   → #cbd5e1 (light grey/white) - wet peaks
```

**ASSESSMENT**: Colors are reasonable but could use refinement:
- Beach yellow might be too bright
- Cloud forest teal is good but distinct
- Could add more visual variety with patterns/textures

### 4. 📍 Current POIs (5 types, 7-9 total locations)

**Strategic Locations:**
1. **Castaway Beach** (1x) - Player spawn point
2. **Tidal Village** (1x) - Coastal native faction capital
3. **Ridge Village** (1x) - Mountain native faction capital  
4. **Mercenary Compound** (1x) - Hostile faction base
5. **Sacred Sites** (3-5x) - Mystical locations with Pulse energy

**Total: 7-9 POIs currently**

## Improvement Suggestions

### 🏔️ Add Cliff Terrain Type

```javascript
COASTLINE TYPES:
- Beach (low elevation coast) - Accessible, soft landing
- Cliff (high elevation coast) - Impassable, dramatic scenery
  * Elevation 0.6+ adjacent to sea → Cliff
  * Color: #57534e (warm grey)
  * Cannot land from sea, must approach from land
```

**Benefits:**
- Visual variety in coastline
- Strategic gameplay (limited landing zones)
- Natural fortress locations for bases
- More realistic island geography

3. **Volcanic Rock** (lava fields)
   - Location: Very high elevation (0.8+), low moisture
   - Color: #1c1917 (black rock)
   - Gameplay: Dangerous terrain, unique minerals

4. **Palm Grove** (tropical coastal)
   - Location: Beach adjacent inland, high moisture
   - Color: #84cc16 (bright tropical green)
   - Gameplay: Coconuts, shade, coastal resources

5. **Scrubland** (between savanna and dry-hill)
   - Location: Low-mid elevation, low moisture
   - Color: #d6d3d1 (dusty grey-brown)
   - Gameplay: Sparse resources, difficult travel

6. **Alpine Meadow** (high altitude clearing)
   - Location: High elevation (0.65-0.75), moderate moisture
   - Color: #bef264 (pale green-yellow)
   - Gameplay: Open high ground, herbs, scenic

**Total Possible: 16-18 biomes** (currently 10)

- **Ridge Clan Territory**: Alpine meadows, cloud forests, stone quarries
- **Mercenary Territory**: Fortified clearings, weapon caches, guard posts
- **Neutral Zones**: Ancient ruins, sacred groves, natural landmarks

**RESOURCE SPECIALIZATION:**
- Each biome offers 2-3 unique resources
- Some resources only available in specific biomes
- Encourages exploration and trade

**PROGRESSION GATES:**

## Technical Considerations

### Adding New Biomes
1. Add to `assignBiomes()` elevation/moisture logic
2. Add color to `terrainColors` in mapRenderer.js
3. Add to `ensureBiomeDiversity()` required list
4. Update terrain passability rules
5. Add resource spawn tables per biome

### Adding Cliffs
1. Modify `markBeaches()` to check elevation
2. Create `markCliffs()` method for high elevation coasts
3. Update movement/travel costs (cliffs impassable from sea)
4. Add cliff color to renderer
5. Update landing mechanics in travel system

### Adding New POIs
1. Create finder method (like `findTidalVillage()`)
2. Add to `placeStrategicLocations()` sequence
3. Add distance/quadrant checks for spacing
4. Create markers in `markStrategicTiles()`
5. Add rendering in mapRenderer
6. Wire up interactions in gameView

## Priority Recommendations

### HIGH PRIORITY (Do Soon):
1. ✅ **Add Cliff terrain** - Big visual/gameplay impact
2. 🎨 **Refine biome colors** - Beach less bright, better contrast
3. 📍 **Add 2-3 Shipwreck POIs** - Easy wins, great for loot

### MEDIUM PRIORITY (Next Phase):
4. 🌴 **Add 3-4 new biomes** (mangrove, bamboo, palm grove, scrubland)
5. 🗺️ **Add Natural Landmarks** (waterfall, caves, etc.)
6. 🏺 **Add 1-2 Ancient Ruins** POIs

### LOW PRIORITY (Future):
7. 🌋 **Volcanic/alpine biomes** (visual flair)
8. 📍 **Hermit camps and danger zones** (quest content)
9. 🎯 **Territorial markers** (world-building)

## Next Steps

Want me to implement any of these? I recommend starting with:
1. **Cliff terrain** (biggest bang for buck)
2. **Improved biome colors** (quick visual polish)
3. **Shipwreck POIs** (easy new content)
