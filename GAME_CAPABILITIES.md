## 🎮 **ULTIMATE TRUTH**

**Right now, the main game (`build/index.html`) is:**
- A beautiful **tech demo**
- Shows you can create characters
- Displays a gorgeous procedural island
- Has stat tracking in background
- Can save/load perfectly

**But actual gameplay (gathering, crafting, exploring) exists only in:**
- `dev/test_gamestate.html` ← **Play this for full experience!**

**All systems are READY** - they just need to be connected to the main game view. The foundation is rock-solid, it's now a matter of wiring UI buttons to existing functions.

---

## 📝 **RECOMMENDED TESTING WORKFLOW**

1. **Main Game** → Create character, see the island
2. **`test_gamestate.html`** → Experience all integrated systems
3. **Settings Menu** → Adjust preferences
4. **Save/Load** → Test persistence

This shows you EVERYTHING the engine can do, even if the main game UI isn't fully wired yet! 🏝️✨
