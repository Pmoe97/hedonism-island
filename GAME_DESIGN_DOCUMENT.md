# Hedonism Island - Game Design Document

## 🎮 Core Concept
**THIS IS A HARDCORE PORN GAME.** Not "adult-themed" or "mature content" - this is a full-blown, explicit, NSFW survival/management/dating/sex simulator. The player builds a community on a procedurally generated island, fucks their way through moral choices, engages in combat, and ultimately creates their own degenerate paradise. Every choice matters and the island constantly reacts to player actions.

**Content Warning**: Explicit sexual content, player-choice morality including slavery and violence, AI-generated pornographic text and images, extreme kink options. This game will give your grandmother a heart attack.

---

## 🌊 Four Phase Progression System

### Phase 1: Survival (Days 1-7)
**Core Loop**: Learn resource gathering, crafting, and basic survival
- Player washes up alone with nothing
- Must gather food/water, build shelter, craft tools
- First castaway discovered (tutorial for relationship system)
- Introduction to basic mechanics through necessity
- **Adult Content**: Intimate/romantic scenes as emotional connection
- **Transition Hook**: Strange lights, distant gunshots, restricted zones appear on map

### Phase 2: Community vs Hostile Forces (Days 8-30)
**Core Loop**: Build community while discovering threats and getting laid
- More castaways arrive (procedurally generated fuck buddies)
- **Mercenaries**: Hostile PMC with weapons/tech, control key resources
  - Patrol routes, guard posts, can be ambushed
  - Secret to protect, will attack on sight
  - Can be killed or enslaved (player choice)
- **Islanders**: Native tribe, initially standoffish
  - Can be befriended through cooperation
  - Can be converted/enslaved through force
  - Know secret paths, medicines, island lore
- Territory tension begins
- **Adult Content**: Stress relief, victory celebrations, power dynamics

### Phase 3: Reclaiming/Building (Days 31-60)
**Core Loop**: Zone-by-zone island conquest
- Capture territories from mercenaries
- Establish bases, defenses, fast-travel points
- Each zone has strategic resources and value
- Final assault on merc headquarters
- Resolution with islander faction (alliance or subjugation)
- Player becomes island's dominant force
- **Adult Content**: Victory sex, power fantasies, harems, relationship deepening, faction-specific pornographic scenes, establish your personal fuck palace

### Phase 4: Commerce/Tourism (Endless)
**Core Loop**: Resort management and profit generation
- Transform island into tourist destination
- Build resort facilities, manage staff, attract visitors
- Income generation through legitimate and "special" services
- Procedurally generated tourist events
- Reputation system affects clientele type
- **Adult Content**: Full porn sandbox, guest hookups/orgies, staff prostitution management, unlocked extreme scenarios, every kink available
- **Endgame Goals**: Earn $1M, achieve 5-star rating, unlock secret endings

**Important**: No hard gates between phases! Content gradually unlocks and layers on top of previous systems. Players can toggle event types in settings to control pacing.

---

## ⚖️ Morality & Choice System

### Core Philosophy
**Every path is viable. Every choice matters. The island constantly reacts.**

### Moral Spectrum
- **Paragon**: Cooperative, consensual, ethical leadership
- **Gray Area**: Pragmatic, situational ethics, mixed methods
- **Tyrant**: Conquest, slavery, forced subjugation

### No Binary Morality
- Players can mix approaches per faction
- Actions have immediate and long-term consequences
- Island atmosphere, dialogue, and events shift based on reputation
- Endings vary based on accumulated choices, not single decisions

### Faction-Specific Morality
- **Castaways**: Can be treated as equals, workers, or slaves
- **Islanders**: Can ally, coexist, subjugate, or exterminate
- **Mercenaries**: Must be defeated, but aftermath varies (kill, enslave, exile)
- **Tourists** (Phase 4): Clientele type reflects your island's reputation

---

## 👥 Character & Faction Systems

### Castaways
- **Origin**: Lost like the player, wash up randomly
- **Generation**: Fully AI-generated (appearance, personality, skills, preferences)
- **Allegiance**: None initially, moldable by player actions
- **Romance**: All romanceable regardless of player choices
- **Recruitment**: Join willingly when discovered
- **Role**: Can be assigned to tasks, combat, or left free

### Islanders (Native Tribe)
- **Origin**: Indigenous to the island, initially hidden
- **Generation**: Fully AI-generated with cultural archetype variants
- **Disposition**: Naturally cautious/standoffish
- **Trust**: Can be earned through cooperation or broken through force
- **Conversion**: Join cause via alliance or enslavement
- **Knowledge**: Possess unique island secrets, crafting recipes, locations

### Mercenaries
- **Origin**: Unknown contractor, protecting a secret
- **Generation**: Mix of archetypes (leaders, soldiers, specialists) - AI-generated
- **Disposition**: Hostile by default, attack on sight
- **Combat**: Primary antagonists for Phase 2-3
- **Defeat**: Can be killed or enslaved (ironically the "kinder" option)
- **Loot**: Drop weapons, tech, supplies when defeated

### Character Archetypes (All Factions)
While everyone is AI-generated, characters can fall into personality archetypes:
- The Leader/Alpha
- The Shy/Timid One
- The Flirt/Seductress
- The Fighter/Warrior
- The Scholar/Wise One
- The Innocent/Pure
- The Rebel/Troublemaker
- The Healer/Caretaker
- The Engineer/Builder
- The Hunter/Survivor

---

## ⚔️ Combat System

### Style
**Turn-based/Multi-phased with stat-based resolution + RNG variation**

### Core Mechanics
- **Initiative**: Determines action order (Speed stat + roll)
- **Actions**: Attack, Defend, Use Item, Flee, Special Ability
- **Stats**: Health, Attack, Defense, Speed, Accuracy, Evasion
- **Weapons**: Melee (clubs, spears, knives), Ranged (bows, guns), Throwables (rocks, grenades)
- **Armor**: Reduces damage taken, affects movement
- **Squad Combat**: Assign castaways to fight alongside player
- **Tactics**: Positioning, flanking, ambush bonuses

### Injury & Death
- **Player Death**: Game over OR respawn at base with penalties (player choice in settings)
- **Enemy Death**: Permanent (mercenaries) or capturable (islanders)
- **Castaway/Recruited Character Death**:
  - **Default**: 99% chance to be "critically injured" vs killed
  - Injured characters recover over time, cannot work/fight
  - Death only occurs through intentional player action or hardcore mode
  - **Setting**: Players can toggle permadeath risk (Casual/Normal/Hardcore)

### Combat Resolution
1. **Encounter Start**: Initiative roll determines turn order
2. **Player Turn**: Choose action for player + squad members
3. **Enemy Turn**: AI-controlled actions
4. **Repeat** until victory, defeat, or flee
5. **Aftermath**: Loot, XP gain, relationship changes (squad members bond)

---

## 🗺️ Procedural Island Generation

### Map System
- **Tile-based grid**: 20x20 tiles (scalable)
- **Biomes**: Beach (edges), Forest (inner), Mountain (center), River, Caves, Ruins
- **Generation Algorithm**:
  1. Create island shape (Perlin noise for natural coastline)
  2. Place central mountain/hill region
  3. Generate river(s) from mountain to coast
  4. Populate biomes based on distance from center
  5. Place resource nodes per biome rules
  6. Add points of interest (caves, clearings, ruins, merc outposts)
  7. Define territories for Phase 2-3 conquest

### Resource Distribution
- **Beach**: Fish, driftwood, shells, seaweed
- **Forest**: Wood, berries, fiber, small game, herbs
- **Mountain**: Stone, ore, rare minerals, medicinal plants
- **River**: Fresh water, clay, reeds
- **Caves**: Minerals, mushrooms, bats (meat)
- **Ruins**: Ancient artifacts, lore, special crafting stations

### Territory System (Phase 2-3)
- Island divided into 10-15 controllable zones
- Each zone has strategic value (resources, location, defenses)
- Mercenaries control zones initially
- Capture zones through combat/quest resolution
- Controlled zones provide benefits (auto-gather resources, fast travel, safety)

### Exploration
- **Fog of War**: Tiles revealed as player explores
- **Landmarks**: Visible from distance (mountain, ruins, merc tower)
- **Pathfinding**: Click-to-move with automatic routing
- **Movement Cost**: Different biomes have different travel speed
- **Random Encounters**: Procedural events while traveling (find resources, meet character, combat)

**Prompt Engineering**:
```
System: You are Sophia, a castaway on Hedonism Island. 
Personality: [AI-generated traits]
Relationship with player: 75/100 (Close Friend)
Known facts: [Player helped build shelter, shared food, defended from mercenaries]
Current situation: [Day 15, at beach camp, evening]
Tone: Warm, grateful, slightly flirtatious

Conversation history:
[Last 10 messages...]

Player says: "I hope so, but we should focus on surviving for now."
Respond naturally in character.
```

### Relationship Analysis System
**Automated every 3-5 messages**:

1. **AI Analyzer**: Sends conversation excerpt to Perchance AI
   ```
   Analyze this conversation for relationship change:
   [Last 5 messages]
   
   Output format:
   Affection Change: +5 (range: -20 to +20)
   Reason: "Player showed care and leadership"
   Mood: happy
   ```

2. **Parse Output**: Extract numerical relationship change
3. **Apply Change**: Update relationship value

- 96-100: Partner/Soulmate

### Adult Content in Conversations
**Escalation System**:
- Flirty dialogue unlocks at 40+ relationship
- Explicit sexual propositions at 60+ relationship
- Hardcore pornographic scene triggers at 80+ with player initiation
- AI generates explicit scene descriptions based on:
  - Character personality
  - Player preferences (kink toggles)
  - Relationship level
  - Context (location, mood, recent events)

**No Safety Rails - Player Controls Everything**:
- Player can initiate sexual content at any time (relationship affects success)
- "Not now" / "Change subject" always available but sex is the point
- Fade-to-black option in settings for cowards
- Content filtered only by player's preference toggles
- AI prompts will explicitly request pornographic content generation

## 🎨 Tone & Style Guidelines

### Writing Style
- **Campy & Self-Aware**: Characters acknowledge the absurdity and horniness
- **Humorous**: Innuendos, puns, pop culture references, dick jokes
- **Explicit & Enthusiastic**: Pornographic content is graphic, detailed, and enthusiastic
- **Dark Humor**: Slavery/conquest themes balanced with player agency and sexual freedom
- **Character-Driven**: NPCs have personality beyond just being walking sex dolls (but they can also be that)

### Example Dialogue
**Castaway (Flirty)**: "You know, for a deserted island, the view is pretty amazing. And I'm not just talking about the ocean. Want to help me work on my tan lines? They're pretty much non-existent now. 😏"

**Islander (Suspicious → Sexual)**: "You outsiders always take. What makes you different from the ones with guns? ...Oh, you want to prove it with your hands? I'm listening."

**Mercenary (Post-Defeat, Enslaved)**: "You won, I get it. So what now? You gonna make me your bitch? ...Fine. At least you're hot."

**Tourist (Phase 4)**: "I paid HOW MUCH for this cabana? It better come with a happy ending. Multiple ones. And bring your friends."

### Visual Style
- **UI**: Modern, clean, gradient backgrounds (purple/blue theme)
- **Character Portraits**: AI-generated in player-selected style
- **Map**: Stylized top-down tiles with clear icons
- **Scenes**: Full-screen AI-generated images for key moments
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions, button feedback, floating text
