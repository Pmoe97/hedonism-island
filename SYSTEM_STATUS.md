## ⚠️ What's NOT Connected Yet

### Main Game Integration
The main game (`index.html`) is a **beautiful tech demo** that shows:
- ✅ Character creation (works!)
- ✅ Story introduction (works!)
- ✅ Map generation (works!)
- ✅ Player HUD (displays!)
- ❌ **Inventory button** (wired but empty)
- ❌ **Gathering interaction** (not spawned on map)
- ❌ **Crafting access** (not wired)
- ❌ **Travel interaction** (static map) ✨
- ❌ **NPC system** (not implemented)
- ❌ **Quest system** (not implemented)

**The Fix:** Wire the buttons in `gameView.js` to the existing systems. Everything is ready, just needs connection!
