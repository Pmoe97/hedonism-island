# üó∫Ô∏è Map Generation & Features Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines the map generation system for Hedonism Island, including current implementation and planned features.

---

## Current Implementation ‚úÖ

### Map Structure
- **Hexagonal grid** using axial coordinates (q, r)
- **Radius 8** = ~200 hexes total
- **1-hex ocean boundary** around entire map edge
- **Natural coastline** with noise-based irregularity

### Generation Pipeline

1. **Elevation Generation**
   - Radial falloff from center (keeps land near edges)
   - Fractal noise for terrain variation (4 octaves)
   - Edge noise for natural coastline shapes
   - Force ocean at outermost ring

2. **Land/Sea Threshold**
   - Configurable threshold (default: 0.30)
   - Edge tiles always ocean
   - Most of map is land with thin ocean boundary

3. **Beach Marking**
   - Land tiles adjacent to sea become beaches
   - Calculates distance to water for all tiles

4. **River Carving**
   - Multiple rivers (configurable, default: 2)
   - Start at high elevation (mountains)
   - Flow downhill toward sea
   - Natural pathfinding based on elevation

5. **Moisture Generation**
   - Fractal noise base
   - Bonus near water sources
   - Used for biome determination

6. **Biome Assignment**
   - Based on elevation √ó moisture matrix
   - 11 distinct biomes (see below)

7. **Biome Smoothing**
   - 2-pass modal filter
   - Prevents single-tile biome patches
   - Creates natural transitions

### Current Biomes

| Biome | Elevation | Moisture | Description |
|-------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Sea** | N/A | N/A | Ocean boundary, impassable |
| **Beach** | Low | N/A | Coastal sand, starting area |
| **River** | N/A | N/A | Freshwater, passable |
| **Savanna** | Low | Low | Grasslands, easy traversal |
| **Forest** | Low | Medium | Temperate woods, resources |
| **Rainforest** | Low | High | Dense jungle, rich resources |
| **Dry Hill** | Medium | Low | Rocky slopes, stone resources |
| **Jungle Hill** | Medium | Medium | Forested slopes |
| **Cloud Forest** | Medium | High | Misty highlands |
| **Rocky Peak** | High | Low | Barren mountains |
| **Misty Peak** | High | High | Mountain tops, difficult terrain |

     type: 'shipwreck',
     name: 'The Broken Wing',
     tile: {q: 3, r: -2},
     discovered: false,
     resources: ['metal', 'cloth'],
     narrative: 'Part of Flight 447...',
     questIds: ['find-survivors', 'salvage-radio']
   }
   ```

2. Placement algorithm:
   - Check terrain suitability
   - Ensure minimum distance between POIs (3-5 hexes)
   - Avoid starting area

       quantity: 3,
       maxQuantity: 3,
       lastHarvested: null,
       regenTime: 48 // hours
     }
   ]
   ```

3. Harvesting mechanics:
   - Click resource to harvest
   - Success rate based on tools and skills

### 4. Fog of War

**Purpose:** Create sense of exploration and discovery

**Design Principles:**
- ‚úÖ All tiles start hidden except starting area
- ‚úÖ Three states: unexplored, explored, visible
- ‚úÖ High ground reveals more area
- ‚úÖ Can see terrain type when explored, but not resources/POIs
- ‚úÖ Story events can reveal specific areas

**Visibility States:**

1. **Unexplored** (Black)
   - No information visible
   - Not on player's mental map

2. **Explored** (Grayscale/Dimmed)
   - Terrain type visible
   - Elevation visible
   - POIs revealed if discovered
   - Resources not visible
   - Factions not visible

3. **Visible** (Full color)
   - Currently in vision range
   - All information visible
   - Can see movement/changes

**Vision Mechanics:**
- **Standard vision:** 1-2 hex radius
- **High ground bonus:** +1-2 hexes from peaks
- **Fog of war updates:** After every move
- **Permanent reveal:** Visited tiles stay explored

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Add fog state to tiles:
   ```javascript
   tile.fogState = 'unexplored'; // 'unexplored', 'explored', 'visible'
   ```

2. Reveal algorithm:
   ```javascript
   revealArea(centerTile, radius) {
     // Mark center as visible
     // Mark tiles within radius as visible
     // Mark previously visible as explored
   }
   ```

3. Rendering:
   - Unexplored: Don't render or show black
   - Explored: Render with 50% opacity, no resources
   - Visible: Full color and detail

### 5. Landmarks

**Purpose:** Memorable named locations for navigation and narrative

**Design Principles:**
- ‚úÖ Visually distinctive
- ‚úÖ Named and memorable
- ‚úÖ Often multi-tile
- ‚úÖ Used in quest directions
- ‚úÖ 3-5 major landmarks per map

**Proposed Landmarks:**

1. **The Spire** (Highest Mountain)
   - Multi-tile volcanic peak
   - Observation point (reveals large area)
   - Difficult to reach
   - Ultimate exploration goal

2. **Dead Man's Cove** (Notable Beach)
   - Crescent-shaped beach
   - Many shipwrecks
   - Dangerous waters
   - Named for its history

3. **The Great Banyan** (Forest Feature)
   - Massive ancient tree
   - Multi-tile canopy
   - Can build in branches
   - Natural gathering point

4. **Skull Rock** (Coastal Rock Formation)
   - Rock formation resembling skull
   - Navigation landmark
   - Pirate territory marker
   - Ominous atmosphere

5. **Crystal Lagoon** (Hidden Paradise)
   - Beautiful clear water
   - Hidden behind waterfall
   - Rare resources
   - Reward for exploration

**Implementation Strategy:**
1. Auto-detect dramatic features:
   - Highest elevation tile ‚Üí The Spire
   - Largest contiguous beach ‚Üí Dead Man's Cove
   - Center of largest forest ‚Üí The Great Banyan
   - Unique rock formation ‚Üí Skull Rock
   - Hidden water body ‚Üí Crystal Lagoon

2. Multi-tile marking:
   ```javascript
   landmark = {
     id: 'the-spire',
     name: 'The Spire',
     tiles: [{q: 0, r: -5}, {q: 1, r: -5}, ...],
     discovered: false,
     description: 'The highest point on the island...'
   }
   ```

3. Quest integration:
   - "Travel to The Spire"
   - "Meet me at Dead Man's Cove"
   - Easier than coordinate-based directions

## Notes

- All "FUTURE" features have placeholder methods in `mapEngine.js`
- Each feature should be implemented and tested individually
- Narrative integration is key - no feature without purpose
- Performance: Keep total entities under 500 for smooth rendering
- Save/Load: All generated features must be serializable

**Remember:** Quality over quantity. Each addition should enhance gameplay meaningfully!
